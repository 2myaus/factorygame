Factory Game (a temporary name) a top-down 2d game which is heavily inspired by Minecraft redstone.

The objective of the game will eventually be to survive waves of enemies by building complex machines and fortresses and collect items.

Currently, the game is a sandbox with several blocks added to enable the building of basic machines and logic systems. The next stage will be adding a basic survival mode.

A demo can be played [here](https://proto.myaumyau.dev/misc/factorygame/)

(Note: there is currently no description of blocks or controls)
